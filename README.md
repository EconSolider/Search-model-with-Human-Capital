# Search-model-with-Human-Capital
Program of a paper working in progress

files:  
baseline: baseline model for stochastic simulation  
  
ver2: extension of analysis for stochastic simulation and perfect foresight simulation  
(model's reaction to a permanent change in search and learning time)  

ver3: set the searching time of students as an exogenous variable.  
Enable us to find the effect of a decrease in E+s and an increase in s.
